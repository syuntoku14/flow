    "# Tutorial 10: Inflows\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks you through the process of introducing inflows of vehicles into a network. Inflows allow us to simulate open networks where vehicles may enter (and potentially exit) the network. This exercise is organized as follows: in section 1 we prepare our inflows variables to support inflows into a merge network supplied by Flow, and in section 2 we simulate the merge network in the presence of inflows.\n",

    "## 1. Adding Inflows\n",
